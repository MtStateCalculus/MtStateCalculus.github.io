      </answer>
      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>To determine which graphed function is the the derivative of another,
we use the fact that the derivative is zero where the original
function has a maximum or minimum.  We note that C
has zeros where B has a maximum or minimum, so it
could be the derivative, so we can have 
<m>C = B'</m>.   
In addition, B has zeros where A
has a maximum or minimum, so that it is possible that 
<m>B = A'</m>.</p>
<p>To confirm this, we compare intervals where B is
increasing and decreasing and verify that these are where
C is positive and negative, respectively, and
similarly compare A and B.</p>
<p>This gives us that <m>f = A</m>, 
<m>f' = B</m>, and
<m>f'' = C</m>.</p>

      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>We have 
<me>T(D) = \left(\frac{C}{2} - \frac{D}{3}\right)D^2 =
   \frac{CD^2}{2}-\frac{D^3}{3},</me>

zero when <m>D=0</m> or <m>D=C</m>, negative when <m>D&gt;C</m>, and positive when
<m>D\lt C</m>, we have (by the first derivative test) that the
temperature change is maximized when <m>D=C</m>.</p>
<p>The sensitivity is <m>dT/dD = CD-D^2</m>; its derivative is
<m>d^2T/dD^2 = C-2D</m>, which is zero if <m>D= C/2</m>,
negative if <m>D&gt; C/2</m>, and positive if <m>D\lt  C/2</m>.
Thus by the first derivative test the sensitivity is

      <answer>
        <p>&gt;</p>
      </answer>
      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>Because the graph of <m>g'(x)</m> is positive for all <m>-2 \lt  x \lt  2</m>, we know
that the graph of <m>g(x)</m> must always be increasing there.  The derivative
appears to be zero at <m>x = \pm 2</m>, so the graph of <m>g(x)</m> must start
out flat at <m>x = -2</m>, and then increases more and more rapidly as it
approaches <m>x = 1</m>.  After <m>x = 1</m> the it increases less rapidly,
finally flattening out entirely as we get to <m>x = 2</m>.</p>
<p><alert>A.</alert>
The graph has an inflection point at <m>x = 1</m>, where the slope
changes from positive and increasing to positive and decreasing.</p>
<p><alert>B.</alert>
The function has a global maximum at <m>x=2</m> and a global minimum at
<m>x=-2</m>.</p>
<p><alert>C.</alert>
Since the function is increasing over the interval <m>-2 \lt  x \lt  2</m>, we know
that <m>g(0)</m> must be greater than <m>g(-2)</m>, and so must be in the
interval <m>(9,\infty)</m>.  (We note that it appears that the magnitude of the derivative <m>g'</m> is also less than one for the entire domain that we are considering, so we can actually give a smaller interval for the possible values of <m>g</m>; any interval between <m>(9,\infty)</m> and <m>(9,11)</m> is reasonable.)</p>
<p><alert>D.</alert>
Again, since the function is increasing over the interval <m>-2 \lt  x \lt  2</m>, we
know that <m>g(-2) = 9 \lt  g(0) \lt  g(2)</m>.</p>

          <m>\$226.79</m>
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>Let <m>w</m> and <m>h</m> denote the width of the base and the height of the container,
respectively.</p>
<p>Since the length of the base is twice the width, the volume of the container is
<me>V= (2w)(w)h =2 w^2 h =  20</me>
so 
<me>h = \frac{20}{ 2 w^2}</me>
The sides have total  area <m>2(2w)h+ 2wh = 6wh</m>, while the base has area <m>w(2w) = 2 w^2</m>, so the cost is
<me>4 \cdot (6wh ) + 15\cdot (2 w^2)</me>
Substuting the expression for <m>h</m> gives
<me>C(w) = 4 \cdot 6 w\cdot  \frac{20}{ 2 w^2} + 15\cdot( 2 w^2 ) 
= \frac{240}{w} + 30 w^2 \quad w &gt;0</me>
<me>C'(w) = -\frac{240}{w^2} + 60 w  = \frac{-240+ 60 w^3}{w^2}</me>
<m>\displaystyle w = \left(4\right)^{1/3}</m> is the critical number. 
There is an absolute minimum at this critical number since <m>C'(w) \lt 0</m> for
<m>0 \lt  w \lt   \left(4\right)^{1/3}</m> and <m>C'(w) &gt;0</m> for 
<m>w &gt; \left(4\right)^{1/3}</m>.</p>
<p>The total minimum cost is
<me>C\left(\left(4\right)^{1/3} \right) \approx  \$226.79</me></p>

          <m>\frac{200}{361\pi }</m>
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution><p>We are given that the diameter and height
are always the same,
so <m>2r = h</m>,or <m>r = \frac12 h</m>. 
Hence, the volume of the pile is
<me>\textstyle
V =  \frac13 \pi r^2 h
= \frac13 \pi \bigl( \frac12 h \bigr)^2 h
= \frac1{12} \pi h^3.</me>
Differentiating with respect to time
(<m>t</m>) gives
<me>\frac{dV}{dt} =
{\textstyle  \frac{1}{12} \pi \, 3 h^2} \, \frac{dh}{dt}
= {\textstyle \frac14 \pi h^2} \, \frac{dh}{dt},</me>
and so
<me>\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{4}{\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}.</me>
If <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 50</m> and <m>h = 19</m>, then 
<me>\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{4 \cdot 50}{19 ^2 \pi}
= \frac{200}{361\pi }.</me>
Hence, when the pile is <m>19</m> feet high its
height is increasing at a rate of <m>\frac{200}{361\pi }</m>

      <hint><m>R</m> be the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in.  Then you know that if <m>V</m> is volume of water, 
<m>\frac{dV}{dt}=R-7600.0</m>.  Use geometry (similar triangles) to find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with base radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> is given by <m>\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m>

      </answer>
      <solution><p>The volume <m>V</m> of a cone of diameter <m>d</m> and height <m>h</m> is
<me>V=\frac{\pi d^2 h }{12}.</me>
We might as well do this problem a little more generally than
stated.  (It actually makes things clearer to use variables throughout
and substitute specific values only at the end.) So suppose the
diameter of our tank is <m>D</m> and its height is <m>H</m>.  Suppose the
depth of the water is <m>h</m> and the radius of the surface is <m>r</m>.
Then, by similar triangles,
<me>\frac{r}{h} = \frac{R}{H},</me>
or
<me>r= \frac{Rh}{H}.</me>
Substituting in the volume formula gives
<me>V= \frac{\pi D^2h^3}{12H^2}.</me>
Differentiating gives:
<me>V'= \frac{3\pi D^2h^2h'}{12H^2} = \frac{\pi D^2h^2h'}{4H^2}</me>
This rate of change in volume would be the rate <m>T</m> at which water
is being pumped into the tank if there was no leak.  However, if <m>L</m>
is the leak rate then
<me>T = L+\frac{\pi D^2h^2h'}{4H^2}.</me></p>
<p>Note that since we have to have consistent units of length, and the answer is
in cubic centimeters per minute, the lengths given in meters have to
be converted to centimeters.</p>
<p>Thus, substituting
<me>L = 7600,\quad D = 550,\quad H = 1400,
  \quad h = 400,\quad h' = 22</me>
we obtain
<me>T = 7600 + \frac{\pi*550^2*400^2*22}{4*1400^2}
  \approx 434280 \hbox{cm}^3/\hbox{min}.</me></p>

        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>To find a lower estimate for the distance the car has traveled, we use the
lowest velocity for each of the intervals <m>0\le t\le 2</m>, <m>2\le t\le 4</m>, 
and <m>4\le t\le 6</m> to calculate an estimated distance traveled in each
interval.  This gives 
<me>\mbox{dist} = (44)(2) + (16)(2) + (0)(2) = 120.</me>
Similarly, for the upper estimate, we take the maximum velocity for each
interval, to get 
<me>\mbox{dist} = (86)(2) + (44)(2) + (16)(2) = 292.</me></p>
<p>Graphically, each of the terms in these sums is the area of a rectangle,
as shown outlined in blue in the figures below.  The lower- and
upper estimates are the sum of the areas of these rectangles.  (Note
that the height of the last rectangle for the lower estimate is zero,
so it does not contribute to the sum.)</p>

<p>You decide to use a left endpoint Riemann sum to estimate the total displacement.  So, you pick up a blue pen and draw rectangles whose height is determined by the velocity measurement at the left endpoint of each one-second interval.  By using the left endpoint Riemann sum as an approximation, you are assuming that the actual velocity is approximately constant on each one-second interval (or, equivalently, that the actual acceleration is approximately zero on each one-second interval), and that the velocity and acceleration have discontinuous jumps every second.  This assumption is probably incorrect because it is likely that the velocity and acceleration change continuously over time.  However, you decide to use this approximation anyway since it seems like a reasonable approximation to the actual velocity given the limited amount of data.</p>

      <solution><alert>Solution:</alert>







Using the left endpoint Riemann sum, the total displacement is the net area of the light blue shaded rectangles, and the total distance is the absolute area of the light blue shaded rectangles.



Total displacement = <m>-4 - 2+3+4+2+3+1+3 = 10</m> feet.



Total distance = <m>|-4|+|-2|+|3|+|4|+|2|+|3|+|1|+|3| = 22</m> feet.







We can also make similar calculations using the right endpoint Riemann sum.



Total displacement = <m>-2+3+4+2+3+1+3+1 = 15</m> feet.



Total distance = <m>|-2|+|3|+|4|+|2|+|3|+|1|+|3|+|1| = 19</m> feet.

Thus we can see that the left Riemann sum is given by

and the right Riemann sum by 
<me>\int_{3}^{4}\,e^{x}\,dx \approx e^{3.5}\cdot 0.5 + e^{4}\cdot 0.5.</me>




From the sketches we can see that the right Riemann sum is an
overestimate and the left Riemann sum an underestimate.

<m>\hbox{Average}(g) = 0.25</m>.



However, when we find <m>f(x)\cdot g(x)</m>, we find that the product
is everywhere zero!  <m>g(x)</m> is zero for <m>0\le x\le 1</m>, so
<m>f(x)\cdot g(x)</m> is zero there, and <m>g(x)</m> is zero for 
<m>1\le x\le 2</m>, so <m>f(x)\cdot g(x)</m> is zero there too.  Thus the
average value of the product is zero, and the average of the product
is not equal to the product of the averages!

The integral is the area above the <m>x</m>-axis minus the area below the
<m>x</m>-axis. Thus, we can see that <m>\int_{-3}^3 f(x)\,dx</m> is about 
<m>6.5  - 1.75 = 4.75</m>.




To determine which average value of <m>f(x)</m> is largest, we consider the
areas <m>\int_{-3}^{3} f(x) dx</m> and <m>\int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx</m>.
If the first (divided by six) is greater than the second (divided by 3),
the average value over the first is larger than that over the second.
Here, the interval <m>-3 \le x \le 3</m> gives the largest average value.

# Solution
############################################################

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To evaluate the definite integral, we need to determine the antiderivative of the formula to be integrated. This can be done term-by-term by rewriting the integral as:

[```\int_{[$d1]}^{[$c1]} \frac{{[$a1]}x^2 + [$b1]}{\sqrt{x}}\,dx = 
            \int_{[$d1]}^{[$c1]} \left( \frac{{[$a1]}x^2}{\sqrt{x}} + \frac{[$b1]}{\sqrt{x}}  \right)\,dx\text{.}```]

Then, we can find the derivative, which is:

[```F(x) =  \frac{2}{5}\left(\frac{{[$a1]}x^3}{\sqrt{x}}\right)
            - 2([$b1])\sqrt{x}\text{.}```]

Now, applying the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we get the value of the definite integral as:

[```
\begin{aligned}
F([$c1]) - F([$d1]) &=
                \frac{2}{5}\left(\frac{{[$a1]}([$c1])^3}{\sqrt{[$c1]}}\right)
                + 2([$b1])\sqrt{[$c1]}
                -\frac{2}{5}\left(\frac{{[$a1]}([$c1])^3}{\sqrt{[$c1]}}\right)
                - 2($b1)\sqrt{[$d1]}\\
&= [!{$p1:%5.4f}] - [!{$p2:%5.4f}]\\
&= [!{$ans:%5.4f}] \text{.}
\end{aligned}
```]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
This integration can be done because we know that the derivative with respect to [`x`] of [`\cos(x)`] is [`-\sin(x)\text{.}`]  So we obtain a [`-\sin(x)`] inside the integral, and we can then integrate to obtain [`\cos(x)\text{.}`] Of course, since there isn't a minus sign inside the integral, we'll have to multiply inside and outside by [`-1`] (which doesn't change the value of course):

[```
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^\pi [$a1] \sin(x)\,dx &=	-[$a1] \int_0^\pi (-\sin(x))\,dx\\
&=	-[$a1] \left( \left. \cos(x) \right|_0^\pi \right)\\
&=	-[$a1] ( \cos(\pi) - \cos(0) ) = -[$a1] (-1-1) = 2 \cdot [$a1] = [$ans]

\end{aligned}
```]

      <solution><m>x</m>-axis is greater than the area above the
<m>x</m>-axis.  We count boxes:  The area below the <m>x</m>-axis includes
approximately 11.5 boxes and each box has area <m>(2)(1) = 2</m>, so
<me>\int_0^5 f(x)dx \approx -23.</me>
The area above the <m>x</m>-axis includes approximately 2
boxes, each of area 2, so
<me>\int_5^7 f(x)dx \approx 4.</me>
So we have
<me>\int_0^7 f(x)dx =\int_0^5 f(x)dx+\int_5^7 f(x)dx \approx -23 + 4 = -19.</me>



By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have
<me>F(7)-F(0) = \int_0^7 f(x)dx</me>
so,
<me>F(7) = F(0) + \int_0^7 f(x)dx \approx 50 + (-19) = 31.</me>

      <solution><m>x=5</m>, we are given that <m>f(5)=0</m>.  
Moving to the left on the interval 
<m>4 \lt  x \lt  5</m>, 
we have
<m>f'(x) = -3</m>, 
and we can find <m>f(4)</m> by knowing that the change in
<m>f(x)</m> over this interval is equal to the area under
<m>f'(x)</m> between <m>x=4</m> and
<m>x=5</m>.  Thus
<m>f(5) - f(4) = 
   (-3)(1)</m>, so that 
<m>f(4) = 
  f(5) - (1)(-3) = 3</m>.
Similarly, continuing back to <m>x=0</m>,
<me>f(0) = f(4) - (1)(3) - (1)(-2) - (2)(1) = 0</me>




Moving to the right from <m>x=5</m>, we know that 
<m>f'(x) = -3</m> on 
<m>5 \lt  x \lt  6</m>.  
So, as before,
<m>f(6) = 
   f(5) + (1)(-3) = -3</m>.  
Similarly, continuing to <m>x=7</m>,
<me>f(7) = f(6) + (1)(1) = -2.</me>




Then, the value of the integral <m>\int_0^7 f'(x)\,dx</m> is given by the sum 
<me>\int_0^7 f'(x)\,dx = (1)(2) + (-2)(1) + (3)(1) + (-3)(2) + (1)(1) = -2.</me>

Alternatively, knowing <m>f(7)=-2</m> and <m>f(0)=0</m> and using the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have
<me>\int_0^7 f'(x)\,dx=f(7)-f(0) = (-2) - (0) = -2.</me>

      <solution><p>Since <m>F(0)=0</m>, <m>F(b)=\int_0^{b} f(t)\,dt</m>.  For each <m>b</m> we
determine <m>F(b)</m> graphically: for regions where <m>f</m> is constant, the

are triangular or trapezoidal, we calculate the area using either of

and may be negative), or (length)(average height).  Thus,</p>
<p><m>F(0)=0</m></p>
<p><m>F(1)= F(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1</m></p>
<p><m>F(2)= F(1) + 0.5 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5</m></p>
<p><m>F(3)= F(2)  - 0.5 = 1.5  - 0.5 = 1</m></p>
<p><m>F(4)= F(3)  - 0.833333333333333 = 1  - 0.833333333333333 = 0.166666666666667</m></p>

The definition of <m>g</m> gives <m>g(3) = \int_{3}^{3} f(t)\,dt = 0</m>.




<alert>B.</alert>
The Fundamental Theorem gives <m>g'(5) = f(5) = 2.5</m>.




<alert>C.</alert>
The function <m>g</m> is concave up where <m>g''</m> is positive.  Since
<m>g''=f'</m>, we see that <m>g</m> is concave up where <m>f</m> is increasing.
This occurs on the interval <m>x\in (1.25,6)</m>.




<alert>D.</alert>
The function <m>g</m> increases when <m>f</m> is positive and decreases when
it is negative, so we're looking for the point at which the greatest
positive area is accumulated.  Thus <m>g</m> takes its maximum value at 
<m>x=8</m>.

      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>Multiplying by the least common denominator gives
<me>3x^{2}+4x+47 = A(x^2+9)+(Bx+C)(x+5)</me>
Rearranging terms on the right hand side, yields
<me>3x^{2}+4x+47 = (A+B)x^2+(5B+C)x + 9 A+ 5C</me>
Now we equate the coefficients:
<me>\begin{array}{rl}
A+B \amp = 3  \\
5B +C \amp = 4  \\
9 A + 5C \amp = 47  
\end{array}</me>
Solving the system gives <m>A=3, \; B = 0</m> and <m>C= 4</m>
so the partial fraction decomposition is
<me>\frac{3x^{2}+4x+47}{(x+5)(x^2+9)}
        = \frac{3}{x+5} + \frac{4}{x^2+9}</me>
The definite integral is then
 <me>\displaystyle \int \frac{3x^{2}+4x+47}{(x+5)(x^2+9)} dx = 3\ln\!\left(\left|x+5\right|\right) + \frac{4\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)}{3} +C</me></p>

      <solution><alert>(a)</alert>
<m>\int_{0}^{3}\,e^x\,dx = e^x\bigg|_{0}^{3} = e^3 - e^0 
  \approx 19.0855\ldots</m>




<alert>(b)</alert>
Computing the sums directly, since <m>\Delta x=1.5</m>, we have



LEFT(2) <m>= 1.5\cdot e^0 + 1.5\cdot e^{1.5} \approx 8.2225</m> 


RIGHT(2) <m>= 1.5\cdot e^{1.5} + 1.5\cdot e^{3} \approx 36.8509</m> 


TRAP(2) <m>= \frac 1 2 ( 8.2225 + 36.8509 ) \approx 22.5367</m> 


MID(2) <m>= 1.5\cdot e^{0.75} + 1.5\cdot e^{3\cdot 0.75} \approx 17.4072</m> 


and
SIMP(2) = (2 MID(2) + TRAP(2))/3 <m>\approx 19.117</m>.



And the errors are just the actual value minus the approximate values,
or



error(LEFT(2)) = 10.863; error(RIGHT(2)) = -17.7654;
error(TRAP(2)) = -3.4512; error(MID(2)) = 1.6784;
and error(SIMP(2)) = -0.0315.




<alert>(c)</alert>
Similarly, since <m>\Delta x = 0.375</m>, we have



LEFT(4) = 12.8149; error = 6.2707 


RIGHT(4) = 27.129; error = -8.0435 


TRAP(4) = 19.9719; error = -0.8864 


MID(4) = 18.6455; error = 0.44 


SIMP(4) = 19.0876; error = -0.0021.




<alert>(d)</alert>
For LEFT and RIGHT, we expect the error to go down by 1/2, and this
is very roughly what we see.  For MID and TRAP, we expect the error to
go down by 1/4, and this is approximately what we see.  For SIMP, we
expect the error to go down by 1/16, again as observed.

Similarly, when the function is bending more rapidly (its slope is
changing more rapidly, so that its concavity is greater) MID and TRAP
will be less accurate.  Therefore both will be more accurate for
<m>f(x)</m> as well.

Over the interval <m>[0,\pi]</m>, the graphs <m>y = 6\sin x</m> and <m>y = 9 \cos x</m> intersect 
when <m>6\sin x = 9 \cos x</m>, i.e., <m>\tan x = \frac{9}{6}</m>, i.e., <m>x=\tan^{-1}(\frac{9}{6})=0.982793723247329</m>.

Let <m>t = \tan^{-1}(\frac{9}{6})</m>. 

Over the interval <m>\left[0,  t\right]</m>, the graph of <m>y = 6\sin x</m> lies below that of <m>y = 9 \cos x</m>. Hence, the
area between the two curves is
<m>\int_0^{ t}(9 \cos x-6  \sin x)dx</m>
<me>\begin{array}{ll}
\amp =\left.(9\sin x+6\cos x)\right|_0^{ t} \cr
\amp  =\left(9\sin t+6\cos t\right)-(9\cdot 0+6\cdot 1)\cr
\amp  =\left(9\sin t+6\cos t\right)-6
\end{array}</me>


<image xmlns:pi="http://pretextbook.org/2020/pretext/internal" width="33.3333333333333%" pi:generated="webwork/images/webwork-159-image-2.png"/>

Since <m>t = \tan^{-1}(\frac{9}{6})</m>, we have <m>\tan t = \frac{9}{6}</m>. Considering a rightangle
triangle with an angle  which opposite side has length 9 and adjacent side has length 6, we see
that the hypotenues is <m>\sqrt{117}</m>. Thus <m>\sin t = \frac{9}{\sqrt{117}}</m> and
<m>\cos t = \frac{6}{\sqrt{117}}</m>. 

<m>9\sin t+6\cos t =  \frac{9^2}{\sqrt{117}} + \frac{6^2}{\sqrt{117}} 
=  \frac{9^2+6^2}{\sqrt{117}} = \frac{117}{\sqrt{117}}=\sqrt{117}</m>.

Thus, <m>\int_0^{ t}(9 \cos x-6  \sin x)dx= \sqrt{117}-6.</m>



Over the interval <m>\left[ t,\pi\right]</m>, the graph of <m>y = 6\sin x</m> lies above that of <m>y = 9 \cos x</m>. Hence, the
area between the two curves is
<m>\int^\pi_{ t}(6\sin x - 9 \cos x)dx</m>
<me>\begin{array}{ll}
\amp =-\left.(9\sin x+6\cos x)\right|^\pi_{ t} \cr
\amp  =6 + \sqrt{117}
\end{array}</me>

Thus the total area is the sum of the above two integrals, which is <m>2\sqrt{117}</m>.

Suppose we choose an <m>x</m>, 
<m>0\leq x\leq 5</m>. If <m>\Delta x</m> is a small
fraction of a meter, then the density of the rod is
approximately <m>\delta(x)</m> anywhere from <m>x</m> to <m>x+\Delta x</m>
meters from the left end of the rod. The mass of the rod
from <m>x</m> to <m>x+\Delta x</m> meters is therefore
approximately <m>\delta(x) \Delta x = (4 + 6 x)\Delta x</m>.
If we slice the rod
into <m>N</m> pieces, then a Riemann sum is 
<m>\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}(4 + 6 x_i)\Delta x</m>, or, more loosely,
<m>\Sigma (4 + 6 x)\Delta x</m>.

Suppose we choose an <m>x</m>, <m>0\le x\le 20</m>. We approximate the
density of the number of the cars between <m>x</m> and <m>x+\Delta x</m>
miles as <m>\delta(x)</m> cars per mile. Therefore, the number of cars
between <m>x</m> and <m>x+\Delta x</m> is approximately
<m>\delta(x)\Delta x</m>. If we slice the 20 mile strip into <m>N</m>

<me>C \approx \Sigma_{i=1}^N \delta(x_i)\Delta x =
  \Sigma_{i=1}^N \left[ 700 + 350\sin(4\sqrt{x_i + 0.1})\right]\Delta x,</me>
where <m>\Delta x =20/N</m>.  This is a right-hand approximation; the
corresponding left-hand approximation is
<m>\Sigma_{i=0}^{N-1}\delta(x_i)\Delta x</m>.  We can more loosely write
both approximations without referring to the number of steps as
<me>C \approx \Sigma \left[ 700 + 350\sin(4\sqrt{x + 0.1})\right]\Delta x.</me>




<alert>(b)</alert>
As <m>N\to\infty,</m> the Riemann sum above approaches the integral
<me>C =\int_0^{20} (700 + 350\sin4\sqrt{x + 0.1})\,dx.</me>
If we calculate the integral numerically, we find <m>C\approx 13462.6</m>.
We can also find the integral exactly as follows:
<me>C = \int_0^{20} (700 + 350\sin4\sqrt{x +0.1})\,dx
  = \int_0^{20} 700\,dx +\int_0^{20} 350\sin4\sqrt{x + 0.1}\,dx</me>
<me>= 14000 + 350\int_0^{20}\sin4\sqrt{x +0.1}\,dx.</me>
Let <m>w = \sqrt{x +0.1},</m> so <m>x =w^2 -0.1</m> and <m>dx =2w\,dw</m>. Then
<me>\int_{x=0}^{x=20}\sin 4\sqrt{x +0.1}\,dx
    = 2\int_{w=\sqrt{0.1}}^{w=\sqrt{20.1}} w\sin 4w\,dw,
    = 2\left[-{1\over 4}w\cos 4w +{1\over 16}\sin 4w\right]
       \bigg|_{\sqrt{0.1}}^{\sqrt{20.1}} \approx -1.419.</me>
(To find the integral we used the appropriate entry in a table of 
integrals.)
Using this, we have <m>C\approx 14000 + 350(-1.419) \approx 13462.6</m>,
which matches our numerical approximation.

      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>We think of the tank as made from infinitely many 'infinitesimal' horizontal slices, with
 <m>x</m> the vertical distance an infinitesimal  slice of the water is from the bottom of the tank (the vertex of the right circular cone).</p>
<p>A cross section through the vertical center to the side is approximated below (not necessarily to scale).</p>
<image xmlns:pi="http://pretextbook.org/2020/pretext/internal" width="33.3333333333333%" pi:generated="webwork/images/webwork-172-image-1.png"/>
<p>Now the large right triangle with height 4 and top side length 3 is similar to the right triangle with height <m>x</m> and top side length <m>r</m>.  So  <m>\frac{4}{3} = \frac{x}{r}\implies 4 r = 3 x</m> or <m>r = {\frac{3}{4}} x</m>.</p>
<p>Therefore the area of every infinitesimal slice is <m>A(x) = \pi(r)^2=\pi({\frac{3}{4}} x)^2={\frac{9}{16}} \pi x^2</m> <m>\text{meter}^2</m>.</p>
<p>The infinitesimal slice has volume <m>dV=A(x)dx = {\frac{9}{16}} \pi x^2\,dx</m> <m>\text{meter}^3</m>, and since mass = density<m>\times</m> volume, the mass of our infinitesimal slice is <m>dm = \delta dV</m> where <m>\delta= 1060 \frac{kg}{\text{meter}^3}</m>.</p>
<p>So the mass of the slice at <m>x</m> is <m>\delta\,dV= (1060)\left({\frac{9}{16}} \pi x^2\right)\,dx</m> kg.  We now must find <m>mgh</m> for each slice.</p>
<p>Each slice at <m>x</m> must be lifted a height <m>h = (4-x)</m> meters, and   <m>g=9.8 \frac{meters}{sec^2}</m> .  So <m>mgh</m> for each slice is <m>9.8(1060)\left({\frac{9}{16}} \pi x^2\right)(4-x)\,dx</m> Joules.</p>
<p>And the sum of lifting all of the slices from the bottom (<m>x=0</m>) to the top of the water level's depth (<m>x=3</m>) is
<me>\begin{array}{cl}
\int_0^{3}(9.8)(1060)\left({\frac{9}{16}} \pi x^2\right)(4-x)\,dx  \amp  =10388\left({\frac{9}{16}}\right)\pi\int_0^{3} (4 x^2-x^3)\,dx \\
  \amp    =10388\left({\frac{9}{16}}\right)\pi\left[\frac{4 x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4}\right]_0^{3}  \\
  \amp    =10388\left({\frac{9}{16}}\right)\pi\big[36-{\frac{81}{4}}\big]  \\
  \amp    =10388\left({\frac{9}{16}}\right)\pi\big({\frac{63}{4}}\big) \\

      <solution><alert>(a)</alert>
We slice the water horizontally.  Each slice is a cylindrical slab of
 radius  and thickness <m>\Delta h</m>, so

<me>\hbox{Volume of each slab }\approx \pi 4^2 \Delta h\hbox{ ft}^3.</me>
The density of water is <m>\delta = 62.4</m>
lb/ft<m>{}^3</m>, so
<me>\hbox{Weight of slab }\approx \delta\pi4^2 \Delta h \hbox{ lb.}</me>
Water at a height of <m>h</m> ft must be lifted a distance of <m>10 - h</m> ft.
<me>\hbox{ Work to move one slice} =\delta \cdot \hbox{Volume} \cdot
\hbox{Distance lifted}
\approx \delta (\pi (4)^2 \Delta h)(10 - h)\hbox{ ft-lb.}</me>
Plugging in <m>\delta=62.4</m> and since <m>h</m>
varies from <m>h = 0</m> to <m>h = 10</m>, the total work, <m>W</m>, is:
<me>W = \int_0^{10}{\delta(\pi 4^2 )(10-h)dh} = 4^2\delta \pi
\int_0^{10}{(10 - h)dh}</me>
<me>= (4^2) 62.4 \pi\left(10 h-\frac{h^2}2\right)
\Bigg|_0^{10} = 156828\ {\rm lbf}.</me>
The total work required is <m>156828\ {\rm lbf}</m>.




<alert>(b)</alert>
This is the same as part (a) except the water must be
lifted a distance of <m>15 - h</m> ft.  The total work is:
<me>W = \int_0^{10}{\delta(\pi 4^2 )(5-h)dh} =
4^2\delta \pi \int_0^{10}{(15 - h)dh}</me>
<me>= (4^2) 62.4 \pi \left(15 h-\frac{h^2}2\right)\Bigg|_0^{10} =

The total work required is <m>313657\ {\rm lbf}</m>.




<alert>(c)</alert>
This is the same as part (a) except that <m>h</m> varies from

      <solution><p><ol label="a.">
<li>
<p>The table gives the amount of calories used per minute.  So in order to find the total number of calories used in a half-hour, use the table to find the number of calories used by a 200 lb who walks for a half-hour, and then multiply by 30 minutes.  Using the table we know a 200 lb person walking uses 5.4 calories per minute; therefore, <me>\text{Total calories used} = ( 5.4 )(30) = 162</me></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the same calculation as in (a), it follows that a 170 lb person swimming uses 9.8 calories per minute.  Thus a 170 lb person swimming for one hour uses a total of <m>( 9.8 )(60) = 588</m> calories.  On the other hand, a 220 lb person bicycling uses 11.9 calories per minute.  Thus a 220 lb person bicycling for a half-hour uses a total of <m>( 11.9 )(30) = 357</m> calories.  By comparing the values 588 and 357 we obtain the answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the values in the table are increasing along the row of values corresponding to a person who is walking, the number of calories of a person walking increases as weight increases.</p>

To evaluate it, we must split the region of integration up into two

<me>\int_0^{8}{1\over v}\, dv =
\lim_{b\to 0^+}\int_b^{8} {1\over v}\, dv =
\lim_{b\to 0^+}\left({\ln v}\bigg|_b^{8}\right) =
\ln(8) - \ln b.</me>
As <m>b\to 0^+</m>, this goes to infinity and the integral diverges, so
our original integral also diverges.

However, <m>\tan(a)</m> is undefined as <m>a\to\pi/2</m>, so this

Thus, because the integral diverges, the area is not bounded.

We note that this is proceeding linearly, because the slope is
constant.  Thus we have <m>y(2.4) = -1.4</m>.  In this case the
Euler approximation is exact, because our initial condition
happens to lie on a linear solution to the differential equation
(see also problem 1 from homework set 11.2).

Note that we are using <m>\Delta x = 0.2</m>.  Therefore, Euler's method
gives 



<m>y(0.2) \approx y(0) + 0.2 (-4) y(0) = 0.1</m>



<m>y(0.4) \approx y(0.2) + 0.2 (-4) y(0.2) = 0.02</m>



<m>y(0.6) \approx y(0.4) + 0.2 (-4) y(0.4) = 0.004</m>



<m>y(0.8) \approx y(0.6) + 0.2 (-4) y(0.6) = 0.000799999999999999</m>



<m>y(1.0) \approx y(0.8) + 0.2 (-4) y(0.8) = 0.00016</m>.

From the slopes of the slope field, we can see that the Euler solution
is an under estimate for the actual solution.

      </answer>
      <solution><alert>A.</alert>
With one step of <m>\Delta t = 1</m>, we have 



<m>B(1) \approx 1300 + (1)(0.03)(1300) = 1339</m>.




<alert>B.</alert>
With two steps of <m>\Delta t = 0.5</m>, we have 



<m>B(0.5) \approx 1300 + (0.5)(0.03)(1300) = 1319.5</m>, 


<m>B(1) \approx 1319.5 + (0.5)(0.03)(1319.5) = 1339.2925</m>.



Note that we can simplify this some: 
<m>B(0.5) \approx (1 + \frac{0.03}{2}) (1300)</m>, so that 
<m>B(1) \approx B(0.5) + \frac{0.03}{2} B(0.5) = (1 + \frac{0.03}{2})^2 (1300)</m>.




<alert>C.</alert>
With four steps of <m>\Delta t = 0.25</m>, we have, following the pattern
we saw in (B), 


<m>B(0.25) \approx 1300 + (0.25)(0.03)(1300) = (1 + \frac{0.03}{4}) (1300)</m>, 


<m>B(0.5) \approx B(0.25) + (0.25)(0.03) B(0.25) = (1 + \frac{0.03}{4})^2 (1300)</m>,



<m>B(0.75) \approx B(0.5) + (0.25)(0.03) B(0.5) = (1 + \frac{0.03}{4})^3 (1300)</m>,
and
<m>B(1) \approx B(0.75) + (0.25)(0.03) B(0.75) = (1 + \frac{0.03}{4})^4 (1300)
   = 1339.441</m>.




<alert>D.</alert>
In part (A), we get our approximation by making a single
increment, <m>\Delta B</m>, where <m>\Delta B</m> is just <m>0.03 B</m>.  If we
think in terms of interest, <m>\Delta B</m> is just like getting one end
of the year interest payment.  Since <m>\Delta B</m> is 0.03 times the
balance <m>B</m>, it is like getting 39 dollars.




Part (B) is equivalent to computing the final amount in an
account that begins with 1300 dollars and earns 39 dollars 
twice annually.  Each step is like computing the interest after
6 months.  When <m>t=0.5</m>, for example, the interest is
<m>\Delta B=(0.03 B)\cdot\frac{1}{2}</m>, and we add this to 1300 dollars 
to get the new balance.




Similarly, part (C) is equivalent to the final amount in an account
that has an initial balance of 1300 dollars and earns 39 dollars
compounded quarterly.

      <solution><p>Since the graph of <m>g(x)</m> is a line, its average rate of change is the same over all intervals.  Since the graph of <m>g(x)</m> is going up, its average rate of change is always positive.  The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> is clearly changing depending on the interval.  If the slope of the line connecting the two endpoints of the interval on <m>f(x)</m> is going up and is steeper than the slope of <m>g(x)</m>, then the average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> will be greater over that interval.  If the line connecting the two endpoints points on <m>f(x)</m> is less steep, horizontal, or going down, then the average rate of change of <m>g(x)</m> will greater over that interval.  If the slope of the line  connecting to endpoints of the interval on <m>f(x)</m> is the same as the slope of <m>g(x)</m>, then the two average rates of change will be equal (such as the case for the interval <m>2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1</m>.

Thus we get different solution behaviors for the initial conditions
<m>P(0) = 1.5</m>, <m>P(0) &gt; 1.5</m>, and <m>0 \lt  P(0) \lt  1.5</m>.  The initial
condition <m>P(0) = 0</m> gives the zero solution, which is an equilibrium
and has the same behavior as the initial condition <m>P(0) = 1.5</m>.  Note
that we can also say that the behavior for initial conditions
<m>0 \lt  P(0) \lt  0.75</m> is different from that for initial conditions
<m>0.75 \le P(0) \lt  1.5</m>, because the former will be sigmoidal while
the latter are strictly exponential.




From the solutions graphed above, or by looking at the slope field,
we can see that the equilibrium solution <m>P = 1.5</m> is stable.  The
other equilibrium solution, <m>P = 0</m> is unstable.




Also by looking at the solution curves, we can see that <m>P</m> is
increasing when <m>0 \lt  P \lt  1.5</m> and decreasing when <m>P &gt; 1.5</m>.
In the long run, we're most likely to start with a non-zero population
and thus <m>P\to 1.5</m>.  The solution curves with initial populations
of less than <m>P= 0.75</m> have inflection points at <m>P=0.75</m>. (This will
be demonstrated algebraically below.)  At the inflection point,
the population is growing fastest.




A graph of <m>dP/dt</m> against <m>P</m> is shown below.




<image xmlns:pi="http://pretextbook.org/2020/pretext/internal" width="41.6666666666667%" pi:generated="webwork/images/webwork-202-image-3.png"/>




Since <m>\frac{dP}{dt}=4.5 P - 3 P^2 = 3 P(1.5 - P)</m>, the graph of
<m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> against <m>P</m> is a parabola, opening downward with
<m>P</m> intercepts at 0 and 1.5.
The quantity <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> is positive for <m>0 \lt  P \lt  1.5</m>,
negative for <m>P &gt; 1.5</m> (and <m>P \lt  0</m>).  The quantity
<m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> is 0 at <m>P=0</m> and <m>P=</m>, and maximum
at <m>P=0.75</m>.
The fact that <m>\frac{dP}{dt} =0</m> at <m>P=0</m> and <m>P=1.5</m> tells us that
these are equilibria.  Further, since <m>\frac{dP}{dt}&gt; 0</m> for <m>0 \lt  P
\lt  1.5</m>, we see that solution curves starting here will increase toward
<m>P=1.5</m>.




If the population starts at a value <m>P\lt 0.75</m>, it increases at
an increasing rate up to <m>P=0.75</m>.  After this, <m>P</m> continues
to increase, but at a decreasing rate.  The fact that <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m>
has a maximum at <m>P=0.75</m> tells us that there is a point of
inflection when <m>P=0.75</m>.  Similarly, since <m>\frac{dP}{dt} \lt  0</m> for
<m>P &gt; 1.5</m>, solution curves starting with <m>P &gt; 1</m> will decrease to <m>P =
1.5</m>.  Thus, <m>P=1.5</m> is a stable equilibrium.

The logistic model is a reasonable one because at first very few
houses have a VCR. As movie rentals become popular and as VCRs get
cheaper, more people will buy VCRs. However, we know that the
rate of VCR buying will start slowing down at some point as it is
impossible for more than 100




<alert>(b)</alert>
To find the point of inflection, we must find the year at which the
rate of VCR buying changes from increasing to
decreasing. The following table
shows the rate of change <m>=(P(y+1)-P(y))/1</m> in the
years from 1978 to 1990.

changes from increasing to decreasing in the year 1986. At this time
(at the inflection point) we expect the vertical coordinate to be <m>L/2</m>,
one-half of the limiting value for the population.  Thus
we have
<m>L/2 = 36</m>, or <m>L = 72</m>, which fits in well with
the data that we have for 1990 and 1991.




<alert>(c)</alert>
Since the general form of a logistic equation is
<me>P=\frac{L}{1+Ce^{-kt}}</me>
where <m>L</m> is the limiting value, we have that in our case <m>L=75</m>
and the limiting value is 75.

We know that a logistic curve can be modeled by the function
<me>P=\frac{L}{1+Ce^{-kt}}</me>
where <m>C=(L-P_0)/P_0</m> and <m>P</m> is the number of people infected by
the virus at a particular time <m>t</m>. We know that <m>L</m> is the limiting
value, or the maximal number of people infected with the virus, so
in our case
<me>L=7250.</me>
We are also told that initially there are only 20 people infected
with the virus so that we get
<m>P_0=20.</m>
Thus we have
<me>C = \frac{L-P_0}{P_0} = \frac{7250-20}{20} = 361.5.</me>
We are also told that in the early stages of the virus, infection
grows exponentially with <m>k=1.6</m>. Thus we get that the logistic
function for people infected is
<me>P=\frac{7250}{1+361.5 e^{-1.6 t}}.</me>

Graphing this solution, we see

Looking at the graph we see that the the point at which the rate
changes from increasing to decreasing, the inflection point, occurs at
roughly <m>t=3.75</m> giving a value of <m>P=3750</m>. Thus after roughly
3750 people have been infected, the rate of infection starts dropping.

      <solution><alert>(a)</alert>
A graph of <m>dP/dt</m> vs <m>P</m> is shown below.




<image xmlns:pi="http://pretextbook.org/2020/pretext/internal" width="41.6666666666667%" pi:generated="webwork/images/webwork-205-image-1.png"/>




Thus, <m>dP/dt</m> is negative when <m>0 \lt  P \lt  b/a</m> and positive when
<m>b/a \lt  P \lt  \infty</m> (we ignore <m>P \lt  0</m>, because this doesn't make
sense for a population).




<alert>(b)</alert>

We can see from the graph above that <m>P</m> is a decreasing function when
<m>P\lt \frac{b}{a}</m>.  Similarly, when <m>P&gt;\frac{b}{a}</m>, the sign of 
<m>dP/dt</m> is
positive, so <m>P</m> is an increasing function.  Thus solution curves
starting above <m>\frac{b}{a}</m> are increasing, and those starting below
<m>\frac{b}{a}</m> are decreasing.



We can also see that for <m>P&gt;\frac{b}{a}</m>, the slope,
<m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m>, increases with <m>P</m>,
so the graph of <m>P</m> against <m>t</m> is concave up. For <m>0\lt P\lt \frac{b}{a}</m>,
the value of <m>P</m> decreases with time.  As <m>P</m> decreases, the slope
<m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> decreases for <m>\frac{b}{2a}\lt P\lt \frac{b}{a}</m>, and increases
toward 0 for <m>0\lt P\lt \frac{b}{2a}</m>.  Thus solution curves starting just
below the threshold value of <m>\frac{b}{a}</m> are concave down for
<m>\frac{b}{2a}\lt P\lt \frac{b}{a}</m> and concave up and asymptotic to the
<m>t</m>-axis for <m>0\lt P\lt \frac{b}{2a}</m>.  Thus, solution curves are similar
to those shown in the graph below




<image xmlns:pi="http://pretextbook.org/2020/pretext/internal" width="41.6666666666667%" pi:generated="webwork/images/webwork-205-image-2.png"/>




<m>P=\frac{b}{a}</m> is called the threshold population because for
populations greater than <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>, the population will increase
without bound. For populations less than <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>, the population
will go to zero, i.e. to extinction.  The value <m>\frac{b}{a}</m> is
an unstable equilibrium, and <m>P=0</m> is a stable equilibrium.

For <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {(-1)^n\over 2^n}</m>,
we have <m>\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} {1\over 2^n} =
0</m>.  Thus, by the alternating series test, we know that this series converges (it is at least conditionally convergent).  Because <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {1\over 2^n}</m> also converges (by comparison to a <m>p</m>-series or by the integral test), our original series must be not only conditionally convergent but absolutely convergent.




<alert>(b)</alert>
For <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {(-1)^n\left({n+1\over n}\right)}</m>,
we have <m>\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} {n+1\over n} =
1</m>.  This means that the alternating series test doesn't tell us whether this series converges: if the limit had been zero, we would know that the series converged, but if it's non-zero the test doesn't help.  However, note that <m>\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left({n+1\over n}\right) = 1 \ne 0</m>.  Thus <m>\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} (-1)^n\left({n+1\over n}\right)</m> doesn't exist, and we know that the series must in fact diverge.

      <solution><m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1} b_n</m> satisfying the conditions of the alternating series test, i.e. 


 
1. <m>b_n \ge 0</m> for all <m>n</m>,



2. <m>b_{n+1} \le b_n</m> for all <m>n</m>, 



3. <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n+1} b_n = 0</m>,  


 
we have the error estimate <m>|s_n - s| \le b_{n+1}</m>. 



The given series satisfies the above conditions. Therefore we have to find the first term which is less than or equal 0.0000001. 


 
<m>b_1 = 0.45 &gt; 0.0000001</m>,



<m>b_2 = \frac{(0.45)^3}{3!} = 0.0151875 &gt; 0.0000001</m>,



<m>b_3 = \frac{(0.45)^5}{5!} = 0.0001537734375 &gt; 0.0000001</m>,



<m>b_4 = \frac{(0.45)^7}{7!} = 7.41407645089286e-07 &gt; 0.0000001</m>,



<m>b_5 = \frac{(0.45)^9}{9!} = 2.08520900181362e-09 \lt  0.0000001</m>.



Therefore we have to compute the sum of the first 4 terms.

to be about <m>6</m>.

closer and closer to <m>7</m>.  (Recall that to find a limit, we are

The limit appears to be about <m>7</m>.




<alert>(c)</alert>
As <m>x</m> approaches 1 from either side, the values of <m>f(x)</m> get

      <solution><me>g(x) = g(6) + g'(6)(x-6) + \frac{g''(6)}{2!}(x-6)^2
+\frac{g'''(6)}{3!}(x-6)^3+\cdots</me>
Substituting gives

The degree 2 Taylor polynomial, <m>P_2 (x)</m>, is obtained by truncating
after the <m>(x-6)^2</m> term:

<alert>(b)</alert>
The degree 3 Taylor polynomial, <m>P_3 (x)</m>, is obtained by truncating

<alert>(c)</alert>
Substitute <m>x=6.1</m> into the Taylor polynomial of degree 2:

From the Taylor polynomial of degree 3, we obtain

      <solution><m>\displaystyle \frac{3}{1-3 x} = 3 \cdot \sum_{n=0}^\infty (3 x)^n</m>.
Then we can

<m>c_2 = 3 \cdot 3^2 = 27</m>, etc.  

  



Regarding the radius of convergence, we perform the standard ratio test:
<me>\lim_{n\to\infty} \left| \frac{3(3 x)^{n+1}}{3(3 x)^n} \right|
=	\lim_{n\to\infty} \left| 3 x \right|
=	\left| 3 x \right|</me>
And then <m>\left| 3 x \right| \lt  1 \iff \left| x \right| \lt  \frac 1 {3}</m>,
making <m>R = \frac 1 {3}</m>.

      <solution><m>\displaystyle c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}</m>, e.g. 



<m>\displaystyle c_0 = \frac{f(0)}{0!} = 0</m>. 



<m>\displaystyle c_1 = \frac{f'(0)}{1!}</m>; 



<m>\displaystyle f'(x)=3 \arctan(7 x) + 3 x\frac{1}{(7 x)^2+1}7 
= 3 \arctan(7 x) + \frac{21 x}{49 x^2+1}</m>; 


 
<m>c_1 = 0</m>.



<m>\displaystyle c_2 = \frac{f''(0)}{2!}</m>; 



<m>\displaystyle 
f''(x) = \left( 3 \arctan(7 x) + \frac{21 x}{49 x^2+1} \right)'</m> 


 
<m>\displaystyle = 
\frac{21}{49 x^2+1} + \frac{21(49 x^2+1)-21 x49\cdot 2x}{(49 x^2+1)^2}</m>


 
<m>\displaystyle
= \frac{1029 x^2 + 21}{(49 x^2+1)^2} + \frac{21 - 1029 x^2}{(49 x^2+1)^2}
= \frac{42}{(49 x^2+1)^2}</m>;



<m>\displaystyle c_2 = \frac{42}{2} = 21</m>;



and so on. Another way is to use the power series for arctan:  


   
<m>\displaystyle \arctan(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{t^{2n+1}}{2n+1} 
= t-\frac{t^3}{3}+\frac{t^5}{5}-\frac{t^7}{7}+...</m>.



Then 



<m>\displaystyle 3 x \arctan(7 x) = 
3 x \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{(7 x)^{2n+1}}{2n+1} = 
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{3\cdot 7^{2n+1}}{2n+1} x^{2n+2}</m>
<m>\displaystyle  
= 21 x^2 - \frac{1029}{3} x^4 + \frac{50421}{5} x^6 - \frac{2470629}{7} x^7+...</m>. 



So <m>c_0=0</m>, <m>c_1=0</m>, <m>c_2=21</m>, <m>c_3=0</m>, <m>c_4=-\frac{1029}{3}=-343</m>...



This is an alternating series. It converges if and only if 
<m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{3 \cdot (7 x)^{2n+1}}{2n+1}=0</m>. 
This limit is equal to 0 if and only if <m>|7 x| \le 1</m>, 
so <m>\displaystyle |x|\le \frac{1}{7}</m>. 
Therefore the radius of convergence is <m>\displaystyle \frac{1}{7}</m>.

From this, and from the given formula for <m>f(x)</m>, we can see that



<m>\lim\limits_{x\to 4^{+}}\, f(x) = 12</m>, and



<m>\lim\limits_{x\to 4^{-}}\, f(x) = 12</m>.



These are the same value, so we know that the limit must exist:
<m>\lim\limits_{x\to 4}\, f(x) = 12</m>.



Note, however, that <m>f(x)</m> is not continuous at <m>x=4</m> since
<m>f(4)=4 \ne 12</m>.

      <solution><alert>A.</alert>
Recall that the derivative is negative when the function is decreasing.  So
we're looking for a point on the graph where the function is decreasing;
one such point is <m>x = 1</m>.




<alert>B.</alert>
The function is negative when the function is below the <m>x</m>-axis.  One such point is
<m>x = 1.5</m>.




<alert>C.</alert>
The derivative of the function is smallest (most negative) when the function is decreasing
the fastest. This occurs at <m>x \approx 3.25</m>.




<alert>D.</alert>
The derivative of the function is zero when the function has a horizontal
tangent.  One such point is <m>x \approx 1.45</m>.




<alert>E.</alert>
Finally, we're looking for a point where the derivative is the same as the
derivative at <m>x = 2.25</m>.  This means that we want the slope of a tangent
to the curve to be approximately the same as it is at <m>x = 2.25</m>.  Such a
point is <m>x = 1.75</m>.

<alert>B.</alert>
From the figure, it appears that
<m>f(6) - f(4)</m> &gt;
<m>f(4) - f(2)</m>.



<alert>C.</alert>
The quantity <m>\frac{f(4)-f(2)}{4-2}</m>
represents the slope of the secant line connecting the points on the graph
at <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=4</m>. This is less than the slope of the
secant line connecting the points at <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=6</m>, which
is <m>\frac{f(6)-f(2)}{6-2}</m>



<alert>D.</alert>
The function is less steep at <m>x=2</m> than at <m>x=8</m>, so
<m>f'(2)</m> &lt; <m>f'(8)</m>.

rounded to one decimal place.  We can check that this is accurate to

This agrees with our previous result to one decimal place, so <m>f'(3)\approx

The statement <m>f(300) = 325</m> means that it costs 325 dollars to
produce 300 gallons of ice cream.




<alert>(b)</alert>
The statement <m>f'(300) = 1.8</m> means that when the number of
gallons produced is 300, costs are increasing by 1.8 dollars/gallon
In other words, it costs about 1.8 dollars to produce the
301st gallon of ice cream.

is the number of Calories consumed per day:



<alert>(a)</alert>
<m>f(1500) = 150</m> means that consuming 1500 cal each day results in a
weight of 150 lb (the units of 1500 are cal, and 150 lb).



<alert>(b)</alert>
<m>f'(2000)=0</m> means that consuming 2000 cal each day causes neither
weight gain nor loss (the units of the 2000 are cal, and 0 lb/cal).



<alert>(c)</alert>
<m>f^{-1}(160)=2100</m> means that a weight of 160 lb is caused by a
consumption of 2100 cal each day (the units of 160 are lb, and 2100 cal).



<alert>(d)</alert>
The units of <m>dW/dc</m> are lb/cal



<alert>(e)</alert>

      <solution><m>f</m> is
positive, negative, or zero by whether the point is plotted above,
below, or on the <m>x</m>-axis.  The sign of <m>f'</m> is determined by
the slope of the function at the point: if the function is increasing,
then <m>f'&gt;0</m>; if it is decreasing, <m>f'\lt 0</m>, and if it is neither
increasing nor decreasing, then <m>f'=0</m>.  Similarly, the sign of
<m>f''</m> is determined by the concavity of the function: if the function
is concave up, then <m>f''&gt;0</m>, if it is concave down, <m>f''\lt 0</m>.  This
gives the table

Since <m>f'</m> is everywhere positive, <m>f</m> is everywhere increasing.
Hence the greatest value of <m>f</m> is at x6 and the least value
of <m>f</m> is at x1.





<alert>C,D.</alert>
Directly from the graph, we see that <m>f'</m>
is greatest at x5 and least at x3.





<alert>E,F.</alert>
Since <m>f''</m> gives the
slope of the graph of <m>f'</m>, <m>f''</m> is greatest where <m>f'</m> is
rising most rapidly, namely at x4, and <m>f''</m> is least where
<m>f'</m> is falling most rapidly, namely at x6.

As <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m> from either side, the values of
<m>f(x)</m> get closer and closer to <m>-6</m>, so the limit appears
to be about <m>-6</m>.




<alert>(b)</alert>
As <m>x</m> approaches 0 from either side, the values of <m>f(x)</m> get
closer and closer to <m>-10</m>.  (Recall that to find a limit, we are
interested in what happens to the function near <m>x</m> but not at <m>x</m>.)
The limit appears to be about <m>-10</m>.




<alert>(c)</alert>
As <m>x</m> approaches 2 from either side, the values of <m>f(x)</m> get
closer and closer to <m>-6</m> on one side of <m>x = 2</m> and get
closer and closer to <m>0</m> on the other side of <m>x = 2</m>.
Thus the limit does not exist.




<alert>(d)</alert>
As <m>x</m> approaches 3 from either side, the values of <m>f(x)</m> get
closer and closer to 4.  (Again, recall that we don't care what
happens right at <m>x = 3</m>.)  The limit appears to be about 4.

From this, and from the given formula for <m>f(x)</m>, we can see that



<m>\lim\limits_{x\to 2^{+}}\, f(x) = 3</m>, and



<m>\lim\limits_{x\to 2^{-}}\, f(x) = 3</m>.



These are the same value, so we know that the limit must exist:
<m>\lim\limits_{x\to 2}\, f(x) = 3</m>.



Note, however, that <m>f(x)</m> is not continuous at <m>x=2</m> since
<m>f(2)=2 \ne 3</m>.

      </answer>
      <solution><p>Using the chain rule, we know that <m>h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)</m>.
We use slope to compute the derivatives.  Since <m>f(x)</m> is linear on
the interval <m>0 \lt  x \lt  2</m>, we compute the slope of the line to see
that <m>f'(x) = 1.5</m> on this interval.  Similarly, we compute the slope
on the interval <m>2 \lt  x \lt  4</m> to see that <m>f'(x) = -1.5</m>. 
Since <m>f(x)</m> has a corner at <m>x = 2</m>, we know that
<m>f'(2)</m> does not exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, <m>g(x)</m> is linear on the interval shown, and we see that
the slope of <m>g(x)</m> on this interval is <m>-0.75</m> so we have 
<m>g'(x) = -0.75</m>.</p>
<p>Then <m>h'(1) = f'(g(1))\cdot g'(1) = f'(2.25) (-0.75)
= (-1.5) (-0.75) = 1.13</m></p>
<p><m>h'(2) = f'(g(2))\cdot g'(2) = f'(1.5) (-0.75) 
= (1.5) (-0.75) = -1.13</m></p>
<p><m>h'(3) = f'(g(3))\cdot g'(3) = f'(0.75) (-0.75) 
= (1.5) (-0.75) = -1.13</m></p>

      <solution><m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x^2}}\cdot

or, simplifying the second term,

Thus <m>f</m> is a constant function!  We can check a few values to
confirm this: 
<m>f(1) = \arctan(1) + \arctan(1) \approx 0.785392 + 0.7853982 = 1.5707963</m>,



<m>f(2) = \arctan(2) + \arctan(\frac12) \approx 1.1071487 + 0.4636476 = 1.5707963</m>, and


 
<m>f(3) = \arctan(3) + \arctan(\frac13) \approx 1.2490458 + 0.3217506 = 1.5707963</m>.

Thus, <m>f'(2)=4</m>.



By the chain rule
<me>h'(2) = 5(f(2))^{4}\cdot f'(2) =5\cdot 5^{4}\cdot 4 = 12500.</me>





Because <m>g(x)</m> is the inverse function of <m>f</m>, we know that 
<m>g(5) = 2</m>.  Then note that <m>f(g(x)) = f(f^{-1}(x)) = x</m>,
so <m>f(g(x)) = x</m>.  Differentiating both sides of the equation, 
<m>f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x) = 1</m>, so <m>g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}</m>.
Thus 
<m>g'(5) = \frac{1}{f'(g(5))} = \frac{1}{f'(2)} = \frac1{4}</m>.

      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>From the graph, we see that <m>f(x)</m> appears to have one
critical point, at <m>x=0</m>, and two inflection points, one
between 0 and 1 and the other between 0 and -1.</p>
<p>To find the critical points, we set <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.  Since
<m>f'(x) = {2(8)x\over 8 x^2 + 1} = 0</m>, there is one solution, <m>x = 0</m>. The
only critical point is at <m>x=0</m>.</p>
<p>To find the inflection points, we find <m>f''(x)</m> and determine
where it is zero.
<me>f''(x) = {16 (8 x^2 + 1) - 256 x^2\over(8 x^2+1)^2} = {16( 1 - 8 x^2 )\over(8 x^2+1)^2}.</me>
For this to be zero, we must have 
<m>-1 + 8 x^2 = 0</m>, or <m>x = \pm 1/\sqrt{8}</m>.
There are exactly two inflection points, at 
<m>x = -1/\sqrt{8} \approx -0.354</m> and 
<m>x = 1/\sqrt{8} \approx 0.354</m>.</p>

      </answer>
      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>We find inflection points by determining where <m>f''(x)</m> changes
sign.  
<m>f'(x) = 6\cdot 4x^{3}+34\cdot 3x^{2}-18\cdot 2x</m>, so <m>f''(x) = 6\cdot 4\cdot 3x^{2}+34\cdot 3\cdot 2x-36 = 12(6 x - 1)(x + 3)</m>.
So we see that <m>f''(x)</m> changes sign at <m>x = 1/6</m> and <m>x = -3</m>.</p>
