<p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>Because the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g'(x)\)</span> is positive for all <span class="process-math">\(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\text{,}\)</span> we know that the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> must always be increasing there.  The derivative appears to be zero at <span class="process-math">\(x = \pm 2\text{,}\)</span> so the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> must start out flat at <span class="process-math">\(x = -2\text{,}\)</span> and then increases more and more rapidly as it approaches <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{.}\)</span>  After <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\)</span> the it increases less rapidly, finally flattening out entirely as we get to <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p><em class="alert">A.</em> The graph has an inflection point at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{,}\)</span> where the slope changes from positive and increasing to positive and decreasing.</p>
<p><em class="alert">B.</em> The function has a global maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> and a global minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=-2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p><em class="alert">C.</em> Since the function is increasing over the interval <span class="process-math">\(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(g(0)\)</span> must be greater than <span class="process-math">\(g(-2)\text{,}\)</span> and so must be in the interval <span class="process-math">\((9,\infty)\text{.}\)</span>  (We note that it appears that the magnitude of the derivative <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> is also less than one for the entire domain that we are considering, so we can actually give a smaller interval for the possible values of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{;}\)</span> any interval between <span class="process-math">\((9,\infty)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((9,11)\)</span> is reasonable.)</p>
<p><em class="alert">D.</em> Again, since the function is increasing over the interval <span class="process-math">\(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(g(-2) = 9 \lt  g(0) \lt  g(2)\text{.}\)</span></p>
