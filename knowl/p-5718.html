<p>Note that in the second to last step we have an indefinite integral on the left hand side of the equation. Since it is a family of functions we need a family of functions on the right hand side as well which required the introduction of the integration constant <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Also note that since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is an aribitrary constant dividing by 2 in the final step doesn't change that. It is traditional to just write <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> although it is a different arbitrary constant than the constant in the previous line.</p>
