Since <span class="process-math">\(\Delta B\)</span> is 0.04 times the balance <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> it is like getting 40 dollars. Part (B) is equivalent to computing the final amount in an account that begins with 1000 dollars and earns 40 dollars twice annually.  Each step is like computing the interest after 6 months.  When <span class="process-math">\(t=0.5\text{,}\)</span> for example, the interest is <span class="process-math">\(\Delta B=(0.04 B)\cdot\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\)</span> and we add this to 1000 dollars to get the new balance. Similarly, part (C) is equivalent to the final amount in an account that has an initial balance of 1000 dollars and earns 40 dollars compounded quarterly.</div></body>
